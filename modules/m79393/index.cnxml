A more visual way is to graph the ordered pairs. A <emphasis>scatterplot</emphasis> is the name <emphasis>statisticians</emphasis> give to this type of graph. The following examples illustrates a table and its corresponding scatterplot.</para><example id="eip-613"><title>Dropped Ball</title><para id="eip-733">A ball is dropped and how high off the ground it is when it is dropped and how high it bounces are measured. Those values are an ordered pair: (release height, bounce height). If the ball is dropped at various heights there will be many ordered pairs. The bounce height depends on the release height. We say that the bounce height is the <emphasis>dependent variable</emphasis> because its value depends on the release height which is the <emphasis>independent variable</emphasis>. When we make a scatterplot it is normal to put the independent variable on the X-axis and the dependent variable on the Y-axis.</para>

<para id="element-83">A scatterplot shows the <emphasis>direction</emphasis> of a relationship between the variables. A clear direction happens when there is either:
<list id="list1" list-type="bulleted">

</media></figure><para id="element-243">The scatterplot in figure 5a above is an exponential growth pattern. It is an example of a pattern that is not linear. 
<newline/>
<newline/>
Linear patterns are quite common. The linear relationship is strong if the points are close to a straight line, except in the case of a horizontal line where there is no relationship. If we think that the points show a linear relationship, we can draw a line on the scatterplot that is reasonable close to almost all of the points. In a more advanced class, one would use an exact technique called <emphasis>regression</emphasis> to determine the formula for this line. The line is called the <emphasis>regression line</emphasis> or the <emphasis>Line of Best Fit</emphasis>. This line can be used to make predictions for the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable.</para><para id="eip-50"><title>Interpolation and Extrapolation</title>Once a line has been drawn showing the linear relationship, the equation for the line can be determined using techniques explained earlier in this chapter. Rarely will the line be a perfect fit and go through all of the points. The line is a <emphasis>model</emphasis> that should give a close estimate of the dependent variable for values of the independent variable that may not be present in the data.<newline/>
<newline/>When a value of the independent variable lies between two values of the independent variable already in the data this is called <emphasis>interpolation.</emphasis><newline/>
When the value of the independent variable is less than the least of the independent variable already in the data or greater than the greatest of the independent variable already in the data this is called <emphasis>extrapolation.</emphasis><newline/>
<newline/>Models aren't guaranteed to accurately predict the dependent variable. As a practical matter, interpolated values are much more accurate than extrapolated values.</para><para id="eip-600"><title>Dropped Ball part 2</title>After drawing a line through the data it was determined that the equation for the line was y = 0.7x. Use this equation to predict the height of the bounce when the drop height is 250 cm. Is this interpolation or extrapolation?<newline/>
<newline/>
y = 0.7 (250 cm) = 175 cm. This is interpolation because 250 cm is between 270 cm and 240 cm.<newline/>
Notice that 175 cm is between the bounce height for 270 cm (189 cm) and 240 cm (168 cm) so this makes sense.</para><section id="eip-407" class="summary">
<title>Section Review</title><para id="fs-idm18585216">Scatterplots are particularly helpful graphs when we want to see if there is a linear relationship among data points. They indicate both the direction of the relationship between the <m:math><m:mi>x</m:mi></m:math> variables and the <m:math><m:mi>y</m:mi></m:math> variables, and the strength of the relationship.<newline/>
<newline/>
If a linear relationship exists between the independent and dependent variables then it is appropriate to find a linear equation that relates the two variables. This equation can be used for interpolation and extrapolation.</para></section>
